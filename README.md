# SAFEHX-PIDDec
This is a repository for essential files used in the identification and development of the PID Decoupler of the SAFEHX heat exchanger. Identification was done using Octave, the model was done in Scilab, and the optimization with RSM method was carried out in Python. A .bat file scrypt was used for looping the optimization step.
